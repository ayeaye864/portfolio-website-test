    <div class="middle_page"><!--move content to center of the page-->
        <p><strong>Commission Process</strong></p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Commissions are made either through the <a href="../commission/commission.html">form</a> on the
                Commissions Page,
                or through email enquriries.</li>
            <li>Clients will pay for <strong class="special">half of the price upfront</strong> before the commission is
                approved and the other half after
                commission is complete. Failure to provide the second half of payment is a violation of the Terms of
                Service
                and PROJECT AYA will not send any work to the client and not send a refund.</li>
            <li>PROJECT AYA will send an estimated deadline for completion to the client via email. Clients can check on
                the
                progress of their commission through the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7ZUNiYDo">TRELLO board</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The client must be able to receive messages <strong class="special">via email</strong>. If a client
                fails to respond to an email within 7 days,
                PROJECT AYA has the right to continue the commission without client input, or terminate the commission.
            </li>
            <li>Clients must provide enough reference or visual information when commissioning. PROJECT AYA may ask for
                further
                references at any stage of the commission. Clients must own the rights to any reference they provide.
                Explicit
                and sexual references will not be allowed.</li>
            <li>During the commission process, clients have <strong class="special">3 minor revisions for free</strong>.
                Parts which have been previosly confirmed
                will no longer count as a minor revision and clients will have to state a reason for change and/or pay a
                revision
                fee depending on the scale of change. PROJECT AYA has the right to decline any revisions outside of this
                process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>After Completion</strong></p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Clients <strong class="special">must credit PROJECT AYA</strong> when displaying their commission
                online.</li>
            <li>The commission request will be open for <strong class="special">7 days after completion</strong>. After
                that, the commission request will close.
                For further work or revisions after this date, contact PROJECT AYA to set up a new commission form.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cancellations and Updates</strong></p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>PROJECT AYA has the right to terminate the project or business relationship if the Terms of Services are
                violated.</li>
            <li>PROJECT AYA may cancel the commission request at any time by informing the other party. If a commission
                has
                been terminated, clients may receive a full or partial refund depending on the state of the project.
            </li>
            <li>PROJECT AYA may change the Terms of Services at any point. Please stay up-top date with them if you are
                thinking of purchasing content.
                Clients will be notified if affected.</li>
