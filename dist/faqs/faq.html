  <h1>PROJECT AYA</h1>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="middle_page">
    <p><strong>Why commission me?</strong></p>
    <p>You get an original piece of work according to your wishes. You get 3 revisions free of charge and
      a guarantee that no work has been produced with AI (Artificial Intelligence). Our prices are lower than
      the market rate and you get a commerical licence included with the price.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How do I commission/contact you?</strong></p>
    <p>For single commissions, use the <a href="../commission/commission.html">commissions form</a> on this site.
      For multiple works or to contact me, you can email <a href="mailto: officialprojectaya@gmail.com">
        officialprojectaya@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you have a waitlist?</strong></p>
    <p>You can check the status of my workflow, you can check my <a href="https://trello.com/b/7ZUNiYDo">Trello
        board.</a></p>

    <p><strong>Why are there different prices for different services?</strong></p>
    <p>As each piece of work is unique to the customer, prices change slightly depending on the time
      it takes to complete a commission. We charge a standard base price for each type of work and increase the final
      amount based on the complexity of the commission (e.g. more revisions, extra assets, etc.).</p>

    <p><strong>What happens to my data?</strong></p>
    <p>We do not use cookies to track your data on this website. All data that has been processed via the form is stored
      in an
      ecrypted database for PROJECT AYA to access for your commission. Only the name you input, type of commission and a
      basic description
      is taken and stored on the Trello board for public access. If you would like to keep anonymous on the Trello
      board, please state so in
      the Name part of the form and/or the Detail section.</p>

    <p><strong>What payment methods do you take?</strong></p>
    <p>At the current moment in time, we only accept Paypal payment.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you accept payment plans?</strong></p>
    <p>Please discuss with PROJECT AYA via <a href="mailto: officialprojectaya@gmail.com">email</a> to discuss this.</p>

    <p><strong>What if I don't pay the outstanding payment for my commission?</strong></p>
    <p>We take the standard base price at the start of the commission and work with you when completing it. The final
      files will not be released to the customer if you do not pay for any extra surcharges. PROJECT AYA then has the
      right to
      keep all files, any payments made and the rights to use your commissioned work for showcasing works to other
      clients.
      All images shared between the process will have a watermark to avoid clients using the files before completion.
